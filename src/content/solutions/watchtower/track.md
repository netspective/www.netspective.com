### Identify the Anonymous 97 Percent 

Did the prospects you meet during your last conference actually visit your site? Are companies you are interested in checking out your site and your offerings? You’ll never know, unless you gather detailed customer information from site visitors.

Visitor tracking technology reveals the identity of the 97% of site visitors who never fill out forms. Watchtower helps you gather this detailed information—names, titles and even contact information—without visitors having to register.

### Focus Resources on Your Best Leads

Not all visitors to your website are potential buyers. Going after the wrong leads are simply a waste of resources. You may spend lots of time and money telling people about your products, but are they really going to buy from you? Watchtower is a powerful sales and marketing tool that can help you:

* Track visitors who would have been unknown to you before.
* Discover leads that are most likely to generate revenue.
* Avoid time and money lost by following unproductive leads.
