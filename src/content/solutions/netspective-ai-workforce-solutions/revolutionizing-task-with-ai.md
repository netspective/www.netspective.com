**The AI Agent Interaction Matrix**  

Netspective’s AI agents fall into four categories based on their level of **supervision (human oversight) and interactivity (ability to interact with humans or systems in real-time).**  

| **Agent Type**               | **Supervised** (Requires Human Oversight) | **Unsupervised** (Fully Autonomous) |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Non-Interactive** (Processes tasks without external interaction) | ✅ Ideal for structured automation  | ✅ Efficient, scales AI-driven decisions autonomously |
| **Interactive** (Engages with users, systems, or external inputs) | ✅ Provides controlled AI-human collaboration  | ✅ Most advanced AI, engages only when necessary |

**How We Recommend Adopting AI Agents**  

Netspective supports all major AI agent models but recommends a **phased adoption approach** to maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk:  

1. **Supervised Non-Interactive AI** → Start with AI that automates tasks **without human interaction**, but remains **under human supervision** for validation.  
2. **Unsupervised Non-Interactive AI** → Scale up by allowing AI to make autonomous decisions **without human intervention** in structured environments.  
3. **Supervised Interactive AI** → Introduce AI-driven workflows that **interact with users** while still allowing human oversight when needed.  
4. **Unsupervised Interactive AI** → Deploy fully autonomous AI that **handles interactions independently**, **only escalating to humans when necessary.**
