Fluent consists of 2 components – Fluent XA and Fluent XS

	eXtensible Agent (XA)
	Fluent XA is a gateway app that runs on any PC or Linux workstation and automates common tasks such as file transfers between on-premise (behind a firewall) and cloud servers.

	eXtensible Server (XS)
	Fluent XS is a series of server apps such as agent admin, gateway monitor, and print processor which acts as the secure conduit between all agents and external cloud systems.
