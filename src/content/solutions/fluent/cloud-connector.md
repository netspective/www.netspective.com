The fluent cloud agent acts as a plug and play cloud connector agent that your customer can install in less than 5 minutes on any server, behind their firewall in their network, and allow you to securely perform data exchange without their IT team opening any special ports, without making any firewall configuration changes, and all without a VPN deployment.

**Use the Fluent Cloud Agent** when you want to securely exchange cloud data with your customersâ€™ internal systems without the hassle of custom software installations, firewall rule changes, or VPNs.
