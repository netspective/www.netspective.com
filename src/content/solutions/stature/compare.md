        <p>Before under going a treatment, it would be good to know the doctors in your area who have performed the same procedures at a lower cost. With healthcare costs on the rise, we would want to know the doctors who could perform the same procedure at a lower cost but maintain the same quality.</p>
        <p>Stature lets you compare the treatment and procedure costs so that you can choose the doctor based on the best prices they are offering.</p>
