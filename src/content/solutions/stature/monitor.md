#### Make Decision with the Most Up-to-Date Information

Stature CM (“continuous monitoring”) periodically collects data from various data sources and updates the Stature data store with the latest information.
With data coming in periodically, Stature provides deep insights in data through

* Revision history and storage of change tracking of data.
* Visualizations showing how data changed over time.
* Alerts/notifications when any information changes.
* Different views of data to different roles of users (e.g. show patients what they care about, show hospitals what they care about, etc.)
