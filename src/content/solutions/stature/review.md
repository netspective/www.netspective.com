**Complete, Accurate Information that Patients Crave**

There is no other place on the Internet where you will get so much background and reputation information about your doctor—all in one place. Stature gathers information from many other review sites to reduce the time and effort you need to investigate your caregivers.

       <p><b>Patient reviews</b></p>
        <p>Read about what other patients are saying about a doctor and their practices—bedside manner, treatment success rates, hospital waiting times, how well medical conditions are explained, etc.</p>

    <p><b>Peer Reviews</b></p>
        <p>Stature also collects and presents information about what doctors are saying about their peers. You get deeper insights into treatment aspects and conditions than you would get from patient reviews.</p>

        <p><b>Fraudulent Reviews</b></p>
        <p>Stature protects you from the risk of fake reviews to a huge extent. It collects details of your doctor from a wide variety of sources such as review sites and state medical boards. It calculates an authenticity score and attaches it to each review and reviewer by analyzing related attributes.</p>

        <p><b>Sentiment Analysis</b></p>
        <p>Sentiment analysis uses natural language processing (machine learning) to extract sentiments from patient and peer reviews.</p>
        <p>Stature analyzes each review for positive and negative sentiments and creates a consensus opinion from this information. A star rating or score is attached to each attribute for which the doctor is rated.</p>

        <p><b>Conflicts of Interest</b></p>
        <p>It is important to know more about your doctor than the usual reviews before you make an appointment. If your care provider is also involved in medical research, the clinical choices he or she makes can be affected by participation in clinical trials or being paid by drug companies.</p>
        <p>When Stature collects other information about your care provider, it flags doctors who might have conflicts of interest so you can be informed before you make an appointment.</p>
