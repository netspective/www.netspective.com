Netspective Medigy is a framework built specifically to support enterprise healthcare and medical informatics applications. Medigy provides healthcare IT professionals, independent software vendors, consultants, and systems integrators with tools that simplify the development of healthcare applications.

We built Medigy as an electronic health record (EHR) add-on. Medigy provides the platform, applications and services that you need to monitor and coordinate treatment of patients across different treatments, locations and healthcare systems.

Medigy enables healthcare providers to:
 
 * **Add customized data** analytics, patient engagement, population health, and care coordination data to any MU-certified EHR.	

 * **Make better diagnostic and treatment decisions** by having access to context-sensitive clinical evidence for different patient groups.	

 * **Improve healthcare delivery** by using well-established, condition-based protocols to find gaps in patient care.

 * **Secure HIPAA, ARRA, NIST and RCM compliance** processes.		
 	

Use Medigy to:

 
 * **Collect EHR data** in a centralized clinical data repository.	

 * **Personalize care** by adding patient location, condition or treatment information.	

 * **Track patient metrics** and monitor quality scores across healthcare systems.

 * **Add genetic information and data** from devices and wearables into patient EHRs.

 * **Promote** Patient Activation.
