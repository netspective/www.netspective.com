## 2. Independent Service Auditor's Report

### Scope and Opinion

This examination of Netspective's system focused on its ability to provide secure hosting and data management services. The audit assessed the design and implementation of internal controls as of November 30, 2024, with a focus on the Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, and Confidentiality.  
The scope of our audit included an evaluation of key technical, administrative, and physical controls within Netspective’s operations.

### Responsibilities

Netspective management holds primary responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the system, including the development and implementation of controls.  
As the independent auditor, our responsibility was to assess the design and effectiveness of these controls, ensuring they were appropriately implemented to meet the criteria set out by the AICPA's Trust Services Criteria.

### Inherent Limitations

It is important to note that no system of controls can guarantee absolute security or performance.  
Our audit did not cover all aspects of operational effectiveness, and we recognize the inherent limitations of control systems, particularly when subject to evolving threats or operational changes.

### Opinion

Based on the procedures performed, we believe that the system and controls described by Netspective meet the criteria for Security, Availability, and Confidentiality as of November 30, 2024.  
We have no reservations regarding the design of the controls and their capacity to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with these criteria.
