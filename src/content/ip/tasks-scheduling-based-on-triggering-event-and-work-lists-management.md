problem-solved-by-the-invention:
 Healthcare systems, medical devices, and software often operate in isolation, resulting in siloed patient information, interoperability hurdles, and limited real-time insights. This data fragmentation hampers effective patient care coordination, decision-making, and operational efficiency. In some cases, healthcare providers need something from patients regularly but do not necessarily want a special trip by the healthcare providers to visit the patients every time. However, the current methods and systems do not allow healthcare providers to take care of these issues without having them to visit the patients every time.

    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p><b>Background of the invention</b></p>
    <p>1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p>The present invention generally relates to reusable software application development systems and methods, and more particularly to a computer system for performing reusable software application development from a set of declarative executable specifications.</p>
    <p>2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p>For several years computer software applications have been written to improve the productivity of individuals inside an enterprise, such as a company or firm. Even from the early days of computers, software applications have been developed to provide faster payroll processing, improved record-keeping, management of sales, and increase the speed of research and development. With these so-called internal applications in place for decades, studies indicate that enterprises have been able to significantly improve employee productivity.</p>
    <p>Moreover, since the advent and widespread use of the Internet and the World Wide Web (“the Web”), there has been a desire by the management in these enterprises to extend their internal application functionality and technology infrastructure to external parties, such as their customers, partners, vendors, suppliers, and other constituents. For example, instead of a salesperson taking an order over the telephone and then entering that order into the internal company sales software application, enterprises are now allowing their own constituents to create orders directly into their internal applications by allowing access to the enterprise's systems through the Web. This is called extending the enterprise.</p>
    <p><b>Summary of the invention</b></p>
    <p>In view of the foregoing, and other drawbacks and disadvantages of the conventional systems, the present invention has been devised, and it is an object of the present invention, to provide an automated system and method for performing reusable software application development. It is another object of the present invention to provide a business-oriented computer software system comprising multi-components or facets including forms, dialogs, fields, validation rules, static structured query language statements (SQL), dynamic structured query language statements, security roles and permissions, value sources, data sources, database schemata, reports, navigation, and personalization.</p>
    <p>It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a unified system of processing, testing, and documenting these facets. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a computer system and method for automatically generating and processing software code, object instantiations, testable functionality, and implementation documentation from a single set of declarative executable specifications. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a computer system that allows a software application developer the ability to declare a single set of executable specifications and receive full unit tests, implementation documentation, and end-user application code from the set of specifications. Another object of the present invention is to provide a computer system for performing software application development that allows the executable specifications to be reused across several projects.</p>
