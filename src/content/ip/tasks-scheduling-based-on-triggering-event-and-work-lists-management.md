problem-solved-by-the-invention:
 Healthcare systems, medical devices, and software often operate in isolation, resulting in siloed patient information, interoperability hurdles, and limited real-time insights. This data fragmentation hampers effective patient care coordination, decision-making, and operational efficiency. In some cases, healthcare providers need something from patients regularly but do not necessarily want a special trip by the healthcare providers to visit the patients every time. However, the current methods and systems do not allow healthcare providers to take care of these issues without having them to visit the patients every time.

## Task Scheduling and Execution: A Closer Look at the Patent's Innovation

In the patented technology, there's a special computer that keeps track of time and events. It creates a timeline that shows when things should happen. This special computer also decides what needs to be done now and what's coming up soon. It plans out a list of tasks that need to be completed. These tasks can include things like questionnaires, tests, process checks, guidelines, and more. They're all things that can be changed and carried out at a specific time in the future. The computer system sets up rules that say when certain tasks should happen based on specific events. It knows when to start tasks because of these rules. 
Different people can be part of this system, and the rules apply to them too. So, when the right event occurs, the system tells the people to start their tasks. There's a device that can detect when the event happens. When it detects the event, it tells the computer system. The system checks who's supposed to do the task. It does this by looking at an identification card that the person uses. This card is read by a special device that's connected to the computer system.
Once the system knows who should do the task, it sends a message to their device. This message includes what needs to be done and how to do it. The message travels through a network of connected devices and includes instructions to start the task.
When the person gets instructions on their device, they know it's time to start the task. They follow the instructions and do what needs to be done.
After they finish the task, they send a message back to the system. This message lets the system know that the task is done and gives information about how it went.
Based on how the task went and the information from the person's message, the system might change the timeline. It decides if the task was successful and adjusts the schedule accordingly.

This adjusting of the schedule might mean changing when something was supposed to happen in the future. It's like updating a calendar to reflect what's really going on.

All these changes and adjustments are made by the system to make sure things run smoothly. It's like having a helper that keeps everything organized and on track, especially when someone's health is involved.

    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p><b>Background of the invention</b></p>
    <p>1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p>The present invention generally relates to reusable software application development systems and methods, and more particularly to a computer system for performing reusable software application development from a set of declarative executable specifications.</p>
    <p>2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p>For several years computer software applications have been written to improve the productivity of individuals inside an enterprise, such as a company or firm. Even from the early days of computers, software applications have been developed to provide faster payroll processing, improved record-keeping, management of sales, and increase the speed of research and development. With these so-called internal applications in place for decades, studies indicate that enterprises have been able to significantly improve employee productivity.</p>
    <p>Moreover, since the advent and widespread use of the Internet and the World Wide Web (“the Web”), there has been a desire by the management in these enterprises to extend their internal application functionality and technology infrastructure to external parties, such as their customers, partners, vendors, suppliers, and other constituents. For example, instead of a salesperson taking an order over the telephone and then entering that order into the internal company sales software application, enterprises are now allowing their own constituents to create orders directly into their internal applications by allowing access to the enterprise's systems through the Web. This is called extending the enterprise.</p>
    <p><b>Summary of the invention</b></p>
    <p>In view of the foregoing, and other drawbacks and disadvantages of the conventional systems, the present invention has been devised, and it is an object of the present invention, to provide an automated system and method for performing reusable software application development. It is another object of the present invention to provide a business-oriented computer software system comprising multi-components or facets including forms, dialogs, fields, validation rules, static structured query language statements (SQL), dynamic structured query language statements, security roles and permissions, value sources, data sources, database schemata, reports, navigation, and personalization.</p>
    <p>It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a unified system of processing, testing, and documenting these facets. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a computer system and method for automatically generating and processing software code, object instantiations, testable functionality, and implementation documentation from a single set of declarative executable specifications. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a computer system that allows a software application developer the ability to declare a single set of executable specifications and receive full unit tests, implementation documentation, and end-user application code from the set of specifications. Another object of the present invention is to provide a computer system for performing software application development that allows the executable specifications to be reused across several projects.</p>
