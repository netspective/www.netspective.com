**Abstract**

A computer system executing a method for performing reusable software application development comprises integrating a data processing system, providing a set of keywords and attributes, and declaring a set of executable specifications using the keywords and attributes, further comprising generating a program code, instantiating an object code, generating a testable functionality result, generating at least one unit test, generating an implementation documentation output, generating a performance statistics output, and generating a project metrics in the data processing system. The step of providing a set of keywords and attributes comprises generating a set of user interface forms, fields, and validation rules, generating a library of structured query language statements, generating a library of rules for generating dynamic structured query language statements, generating one of a web browser report, a file-based report, and a portable document format report, generating a library of security rules and permission statements, and generating database schemata.
